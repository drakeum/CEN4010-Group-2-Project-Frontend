# Background
This project was created for a Principles of Software Engineering class for a group project. Le and Ben coded almost all of it, with Hunter providing some code to connect with the backend and fix a couple bugs. The application was for a website where users would keep records of owned properties. While not very useful on its own (it is intended to connect with the backend, [here] (https://github.com/drakeum/CEN4010-Group-2-Project-Backend)), this frontend app is now public as a record of projects me and my groupmates worked on.
